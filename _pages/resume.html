I coordinate a theoretical-experimental laboratory with a focus on engineering novel protein-based vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostic markers for viral infectious diseases. Synthetic proteins are developed through the use computational protein design techniques and subsequently produced in laboratory. These synthetic proteins are used to capture antibodies from patient sera, to elicit antibody production in vitro, to validate vaccine efficacy in vivo as well as to neutralize viral infections. I have acted as the local coordinator of the ZIKAlliance consortium, an initiative involving 52 institutions in Europe and Latin-America, funded by European Union agencies. I am member of the Fiocruz Genomic Network and scientific coordinator of the Protein Technology/Proteomics Platform Facility of the Aggeu Magalh√£es Institute at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation. I also act as scientific reviewer for 11 research agencies in 6 countries, scientific consultant for EvaMobs Horizon Europe, and have been invited for about 100 conference talks in more than 12 countries. I have also approved a number of grants from Brazilian, American and European agencies, and supervised 40+ postdocs and students at all levels.
